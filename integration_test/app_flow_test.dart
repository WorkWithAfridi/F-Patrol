Tips: 
1. Donâ€™t test for toasts, as they are not in the same widget tree, therefore tests may fail!
2. Avoid testing time-dependent elements like animations, which might cause flakiness in tests. 
3. Make sure the widget tree is settled before proceeding with any assertions or interactions (`await $.pumpAndSettle()`).
4. Use clear, descriptive keys for elements (e.g., `appKeys.signInView.email`) to ensure reliability in finding widgets during tests.
5. Don't test for elements that appear after a delayed action unless you specifically wait for them (e.g., `Future.delayed()`).
6. Ensure your tests do not rely on a network connection or use mock data for consistency.
7. Always check that the state of your widget is correctly updated after interaction before making assertions.
8. Consider using `await $.pumpAndSettle()` when testing navigation or screen transitions to ensure the app has fully loaded.

Debugging Tips:
1. **Widget Not Found**: If a test fails due to a widget not being found, check that the widget's key is correctly defined in both the test and the app. Double-check any key names.
2. **UI is not rendering as expected**: If the UI is not displaying as expected, try adding `await $.pumpAndSettle()` after significant actions like navigation or data loading.
3. **Interactions Not Working**: If interaction elements like buttons or text fields aren't responding, ensure that the widgets are not being obstructed by other widgets or overlays.
4. **Test Flakiness**: If the test intermittently fails, add more waits (`await $.pumpAndSettle()`) before assertions to ensure that the app has time to settle, especially in cases of animations or API calls.
5. **Timeouts**: If the test times out during assertions, ensure the widget tree is fully settled by adding delays or using `await $.pumpAndSettle()`.
6. **Re-running Failed Tests**: If a test fails, rerun it with a debugger attached to inspect the current widget state and navigation paths.

Test Description:
This integration test simulates a complete user flow through the app. The steps include:
1. Launching the app and verifying the splash screen before the automatic navigation to the sign-in screen.
2. Testing the sign-in process with both invalid and valid credentials, verifying the error messages for invalid input, and ensuring navigation to the home screen after a successful sign-in.
3. Simulating the sign-up process by filling out a registration form and verifying that the user is redirected to the home screen after successful sign-up.
4. Testing the forgot password functionality by navigating to the reset password screen, submitting an email for password recovery, and setting a new password.
5. Ensuring that the user returns to the home screen after completing the password reset.

The test covers essential user flows for authentication, including sign-in, sign-up, and password reset functionalities.
